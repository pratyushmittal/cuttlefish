    Before you can send email via Cuttlefish you will need to #{link_to "create an App", new_app_path}. Each App has its
    own settings and usually relates to one application from which you're sending the emails.

    Simple send normal smtp email, with each App having its own authentication details.

  .tabbale
    %ul.nav.nav-tabs
      - @apps.each do |app|
        %li{class: ("active" if app == @active_app)}
          = link_to app.name, "#app-#{app.id}", "data-toggle" => "tab"
    .tab-content
      - @apps.each do |app|
        .tab-pane{id: "app-#{app.id}", class: ("active" if app == @active_app)}
